                                                           Our patients tend to be highly educated in nutrition and the new approaches to holistic health. They recognize, as we do, that the body and mind are connected and both must be healthy for the whole body to enjoy optimal health. The best way, to ensure that, is to balance the body energy. The holistic approach to health is to enhance the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health.

Chelation Therapy is one of the modalities provided as part of the Multi-Modality Immune-therapy Program (M IP). It is a safe. effective way of removing toxins such as heavy metals and metastatic calcium deposits from the human body. This helps to balance of other metal ions and restores healthy cellular functions, disintegrates the plaques in arterioscleroses and thus improves blood circulation as well as the circulation to all body organs. Consequently, this leads to improved body functions, e.g.. it relieves angina pectoris; lower blood cholesterol and fats, reduces blood pressure; reduces heart irritability; improves signs of aging; heals poor circulation ulcers (such as leg ulcers); reduces leg cramps: improves vision; improves varicose veins and pigmentation.Chelation is a series of intravenous infusions of an amino acid called Calcium EDTA (Calcium Disodium Edetate), with mega-doses of vitamins and minerals.Chelation Therapy improves a patient's condition in a variety of chronic diseases such as Coronary Arterioscleroses; Psoriasis: Arthritis; Parkinson's Disease: Lead and Other Heavy Metal Toxicity: Peripheral Vascular Disease: Hypoglycemia; Lupus; Diabetic Complications; Arteriosclerosis and many and others.
